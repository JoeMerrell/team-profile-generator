## Description

From the Coding Bootcamp Module #10 Challenge description: "Your challenge is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, youâ€™ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them."

## Installation


The app can be cloned from GitHub and dependencies installed in the code editor before running (see package.json file).


## Usage

Once the app is cloned and dependencies installed, users can run "node index.js" from the command line in the root directory to start the app. Once started, users are led through a series of questions about employees on a given team. Once all of the questions have been answered regarding each of the the employees, the app generates an HTML page with all of the collected information contained on a set of cards. The HTML page can be found in the "dist" folder.
